# First

## Hello Internet

So It's time for me to get a blog.

Heads up, I like to explain how i think when I write text, so some parts might be a bit drawn out. But hopefully this place might be usefull for you as well.

I will mostly use this blog to write about IT but it's possible I will mention something about running or any of my other intrests.

## What I have done

I started my work at a small IT company in Gothenburg called Zetup now named [Nordlo](https://nordlo.com).

Afther that I joined [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com) working as a ICT engineer (supporting internal RND and testing).

Until then I worked allot with:

* Linux
* Infrastrucuture As Code (IAC)
* Monitoring
* Python
* HPC
* CI/CD

But in 2017 i joined [Alten](https://www.alten.se/) and started working more as a devops enginner as a consultant at Ericsson in a RND project called [CVC][cvc_link] helping out to send data from cars to the cloud.

I also became scrum master, being a scrum master was very intresting and i learnet so much but I feelt that i want to have more time for technology so i left the project after about 7 motnhs.

From 2018 I took a role as Technical Speciallist at Alten working 50% inhouse supporting other engineers with day to day tasks, technical pre-sale, technical intervews, etc.
The other 50% I worked with Kubernetes at Ericsson developing generic services for 5G as a devops engineer.

## What will happen in the future

So now you know the fast version of my professional life.

After the summer of 2019 I'm joning [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/) (IBM depending on who you ask) as a openshift consultant.

In the future I will most likley focus allot on:

* Kubernetes
* Openshift
* cloud
* CI/CD
* IAC (Infrastrucutre As Code)
* Linux

I think all of us have tested some tool that seemed cool and then didn't start to use it day to day.
6 months later you need it again and you have no idea what you have done and you almost have to start from scratch, hopefully I can remove some of the restart time for both you and me.
