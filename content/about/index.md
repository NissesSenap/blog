### So about me and this blog

As you have guessed my name is Edvin, I live in Sweden, Gothenburg and I have worked with IT for about 8 years now.

I will mostly use this blog to write about IT but it's possible i will mention something about running or any of my other interests.

This is mostly a way for me to save what I'm doing and if someone else can use it even better.

If you want to read some more info about you can check out [my first blog entry]({{< ref "/blog/first.md" >}})

I haven't learnt Twitter so if you want to reach out do it on the Kubernetes slack (Edvin), my email or Linkedin.
