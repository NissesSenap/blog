      <title>Infrastructure As Code Blog part 1 Godaddy with Terraform</title>

      <description>Background As you know if you have read my last blog entry  I use GitHub to host my static page and Azure Pipeline for CI/CD. I have chosen Godaddy to be my DNS provider, the biggest reason behind this is that Azure and Godaddy have a partnership and I want to keep things simple. Godaddy is also big enough for other people to develop nice Terraform plugins, something that is missing in the Swedish DNS providers i have looked in to.</description>

      <description>Basic requirements  Trigger CI system at PR (pull request) Give feedback to the user that the PR have passed When I merge the pull, automatically publish my updated blog.  The last one is already solved thanks to that i use GitHub static page to share my homepage.
Tools My plan is to use the following tools:
 Azure Pipelines GitHub hub Hugo Yaspeller (to help me with my crappy spelling)  The reason why I chose Hugo as a static page generator is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Jekyll (don&amp;rsquo;t like ruby) and it feels like a much more modern any way.</description>
