      <description>H# Basic requirements
 Trigger CI system at PR (pull request) Give feedback to the user that the PR have passed When I merge the pull, automatically publish my updated blog.  The last one is already solved thanks to that i use GitHub static page to share my homepage.
Tools My plan is to use the following tools:
 Azure Pipelines GitHub hub Hugo Yaspeller (to help me with my crappy spelling)  The reason why I chose Hugo as a static page generator is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Jekyll (don&amp;rsquo;t like ruby) and it feels like a much more modern any way.</description>

      <description>So about me and this blog As you have guessed my name is Edvin, I live in Sweden, Gothenburg and I have worked with IT for about 8 years now.
I will mostly use this blog to write about IT but it&amp;rsquo;s possible i will mention something about running or any of my other interests.
This is mostly a way for me to save what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and if someone else can use it even better.</description>

      <description>First Hello Internet So It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get a blog.
Heads up, I like to explain how i think when I write text, so some parts might be a bit drawn out. But hopefully this place might be useful for you as well.
