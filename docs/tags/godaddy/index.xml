      <description>Background As you know if you have read my last blog entry  I use GitHub to host my static page and Azure Pipeline for CI/CD. I have chosen Godaddy to be my DNS provider, the biggest reason behind this is that Azure and Godaddy have a partnership and I want to keep things simple. Godaddy is also big enough for other people to develop nice Terraform plugins, something that is missing in the Swedish DNS providers i have looked in to.</description>
